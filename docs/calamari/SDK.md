# ðŸ›  Calamari SDK

The Calamari SDK is a JavaScript library that provides a connection to the Manta Network. The API endpoints you can use to connect to Calamari are as follows:

## Full Nodes

- Manta-provided: wss://ws.calamari.systems
- Third-party provided: wss://calamari.api.onfinality.io

## Asset API (Javascript)

The following is a list of assets and the API call to retrieve information about each asset:

* Token: `api.query.assets.account(asset_id, AccountId)`
- KMA: `api.query.system.account(AccountId)`
- KAR: `api.query.assets.account(8u128, AccountId)`
- AUSD: `api.query.assets.account(9u128, AccountId)`
- LKSM: `api.query.assets.account(10u128, AccountId)`
- MOVR: `api.query.assets.account(11u128, AccountId)`
- KSM: `api.query.assets.account(12u128, AccountId)`
- PHA: `api.query.assets.account(13u128, AccountId)`
* Note: In these examples asset-ids start from 8 to 13

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```sh
yarn install manta.js
```

### Local Development

If you want to develop locally with the SDK, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Manta-Network/sdk.git`
2. Change to the package directory: `cd sdk/manta-js/package`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Build the package for either a browser or node.js environment:
    - For a browser: `yarn build`
    - For node.js: `yarn build-node`
5. Add the following line to your project's `package.json` file, replacing `<LOCAL PATH OF SDK>` with the local path to the SDK:
```json
"manta.js": "file:/<LOCAL PATH OF SDK>/manta-js/package"
```
6. Upgrade the SDK in your project directory: `yarn upgrade manta.js`

# Usage

All methods are called through the `MantaPrivateWallet` class.

Manta-signer must be installed and running. Refer to the [manta-signer](#signer) section for more details.

> If running `manta-signer` on dev mode, you should use the following features: `features=unsafe-disable-cors,disable-restart`.

Refer to [sdk/manta-js/examples](https://github.com/Manta-Network/sdk/tree/main/manta-js/examples/asset-webpack-ts#mantajs-examples) for more thorough examples, and how to run them.

## Node Specific

If running in node.js the wasm module assumes browser DOM exists, you must export Web API functions from node in your project as seen below.

```javascript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

// @ts-ignore
global.fetch = fetch;
// @ts-ignore
global.Headers = fetch.Headers;
// @ts-ignore
global.Request = fetch.Request;
// @ts-ignore
global.Response = fetch.Response;
```

## Getting Started With Manta.js

`Manta.js` is a library that helps you connect to and interact with the Polkadot network. To get started with Manta.js, you'll need to specify the `Environment` and `Network` you want to connect to.

The `Environment` flag specifies whether to connect to a local node (`ws://127.0.0.1:9944`), or the use an actual node from the specified network.

The `Network` flag specifies which network to connect to, either `Dolphin`, `Calamari` or `Manta`.

## Setting Up MantaPrivateWallet

To connect to a specific environment and network, you'll need to create a new instance of the `MantaPrivateWallet` class. To switch between environments and networks, simply create a new instance.

Here's an example of how to create a `MantaPrivateWallet` instance for the production environment and the Calamari network:

```javascript
import { MantaPrivateWallet, Environment, Network } from 'manta.js';

const prodEnvironment = sdk.Environment.Production;
const calamariNetwork = sdk.Network.Calamari;

const privateWalletConfig: PrivateWalletConfig = {
    environment: prodEnvironment,
    network: calamariNetwork,
};

const privateWallet = await MantaPrivateWallet.init(privateWalletConfig);
```

## Configuring The Wallet

`PrivateWalletConfig` has several optional arguments:

- `loggingEnabled`, whether or not non-error logging to console should occur, set by default to `false`.
- `maxSendersPullSize`, set by default to `4096`.
- `maxReceiversPullSize`, set by default to `4096`.
- `pullCallback`, callback function after a pull has occured, set by default to `null`.
- `errorCallback`, callback function after an error has occured, set by default to `null`.

## Making A Transaction

Before you can make transactions, you'll need to call the `initialWalletSync()` method on your `MantaPrivateWallet` instance. This will sync your wallet with the latest data from the ledger.

After every single transaction, you'll need to call the `walletSync()` method to get the latest data from the ledger.

To make transactions, you'll need to provide a `Signer` and a public Address from `PolkadotJS`. 

Following is an example that shows how to get these values, assuming that the `PolkadotJS` extension is installed and contains an existing account:




### Polkadot JS Transaction Parameters

```javascript
import { web3Accounts, web3Enable, web3FromSource } from '@polkadot/extension-dapp';

// Get Polkadot JS Signer and Polkadot JS account address.
const getPolkadotSignerAndAddress = async () => {
    const extensions = await web3Enable('Polkadot App');
    if (extensions.length === 0) {
        throw new Error("Polkadot browser extension missing. https://polkadot.js.org/extension/");
    }
    const allAccounts = await web3Accounts();
    let account = allAccounts[0];

    const injector = await web3FromSource(account.meta.source);
    const polkadotSigner = injector.signer;
    const polkadotAddress = account.address;
    return {
        polkadotSigner,
        polkadotAddress
    }
}
```

Below is an example of how to transact using fungible tokens, there are four main methods that `manta-pay` provides:
- `toPrivateSend(asset, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
- `privateTransferSend(asset, amount, receiver, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
- `toPublicSend(asset, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
- `publicTransfer(asset, amount, destinationAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`

> This example assumes the `polkadotAddress` already has associated public funds.

### To Private

This example converts 10 public KMA tokens to 10 private KMA tokens.

```javascript
// KMA token
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

// Sync with most recent ledger state.
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get private address
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Get private balance of KMA for given private address
const privateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);

// Privatize 10 KMA to 10 zkKMA
await privateWallet.toPrivateSend(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Sync to get latest data after the transaction and check that it was successful.
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// The private balance of zkKMA should be incremented by 10 units.
const newPrivateBalance = await mantaSdk.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### Private Transfer

This example transfers 10 zkKMA to another address.

```javascript
// KMA token
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

// Sync with most recent ledger state.
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get private address
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Private Transfer of 10 zkKMA to another private address
const examplePrivateAddress = "3UG1BBvv7viqwyg1QKsMVarnSPcdiRQ1aL2vnTgwjWYX";
await privateWallet.privateTransferSend(assetId, amount, examplePrivateAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Sync to get latest data after transaction and check that it was successful.
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// The private balance of zkKMA should decrease by 10 units.
const newPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### To Public

This example converts 5 zkKMA to 5 public KMA.

```javascript
// KMA token
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("5000000000000");

// Sync with most recent ledger state.
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get private address
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Get private balance of zkKMA for given private address
const privateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);

// Convert 5 zkKMA back to KMA
await privateWallet.toPublicSend(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Sync to get latest data after transaction and check that it was successful.
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// The private balance of zkKMA should decrease by 5 units.
const newPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### Manta Utilities

There also exists a `MantaUtilities` class with additional functions. Mainly for interacting publicly with the Manta ecosystem. This example demonstrates these functions. This example assumes the `MantaPrivateWallet` class has already been initialized, as well as `polkadotAddress` and `polkadotSigner`.

```javascript
import { MantaUtilities } from "manta.js";

// Get signer version, signer must be running.
const signerVersion = await MantaUtilities.getSignerVersion();

// KMA token
const assetId = new BN("1");

// Get public balance of KMA for `polkadotAddress`.
const oldPublicBalance = await MantaUtilities.getPublicBalance(privateWallet.api, assetId, polkadotAddress);

// Public transfer of 5 KMA to `destinationAddress`.
const destinationAddress = "dmyhNmYL13N7ZKcVYqBQhvrk5kSfrKZUmrjX9vAaM4846bWKR";
const amount = new BN("5000000000000000000");
await MantaUtilities.publicTransfer(privateWallet.api, assetId, amount, destinationAddress, polkadotAddress, polkadotSigner);

// Public balance should now be 5 KMA less that `oldPublicBalance`.
const newPublicBalance = await MantaUtilities.getPublicBalance(privateWallet.api, assetId, polkadotAddress);
```

### Sign and manually send transaction

In some cases you may not want to send transaction to the ledger through manta.js, thus you can get sign result after manta-signer has signed the transaction and send the transaction yourself. This is done by using the `toPrivateBuild`, `privateTransferBuild`, `publicTransferBuild` functions.

This example returns the signed transaction of `toPrivate` for 10 KMA.

```javascript
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

const env = sdk.Environment.Production;
const net = sdk.Network.Calamari;
const privateWallet = await sdk.init(env,net);

const privateAddress = await privateWallet.privateAddress();
console.log("The private address is: ", privateAddress);

await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

const initialPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.privateBalance(assetId);
console.log("The initial private balance is: ", initialPrivateBalance.toString());

const signResult = await privateWallet.toPrivateBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

console.log("The result of the signing: ", JSON.stringify(signResult.transactions));
```

This can also be done for all other transaction types:

```javascript
const toPrivateSignResult = await privateWallet.toPrivateBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
const toPublicSignResult = await privateWallet.toPublicBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
const privateTransferSignResult = await privateWallet.privateTransferBuild(assetId, amount, privateAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
```

Then you can use the signResult to submit transaction by your self. Here is an example on how to verify the `toPrivateBuild` sign result is valid:

Copy the transaction to polkadot.js `Extrinsic` decode:

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_decode.png)

Switch to `Submission`:

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_extrinsic.png)

Then submit transaction.

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_submit.png)

You should see your extrinsic show up on polkadot.js explorer. Then you will notice an increase in your private balance.

## Signer

Manta Signer is a desktop application which generates zero knowledge proofs for MantaPay transactions and manages the private keys of your UTXOs. The signer is open sourced and you may find instruction on how to set it up at [manta-signer](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-signer).
In short you need to install `tauri-cli` and build the signer with `cargo tauri build`. Then run the signer and create your private address by following the user prompts.
If you don't need ot interact with the signer directly you can run a simple test server with `cargo run --example test_server --features=unsafe-disable-cors,disable-restart --release`
